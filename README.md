# T-rex-Game
It is this one One Favorite game from our childhood memory,
that all of us would have played for sure and 
this being the first game that I've created myself makes me even more excited.
I've added few more modifications for more fun and here you go:
👉 Get Player name in the start of the game.
👉 Added Background and border to the canvas.
👉 Collision-detection,Alert notification when game over and then reload the game.
👉 Keep track of high score and player names.
👉 Transition from light mode to dark mode when High score is reached as of then.
